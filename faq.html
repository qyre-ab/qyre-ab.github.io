You can then add up to two additional roles. For example, perhaps you work primarily as a Script Editor, but depending on the production you might want to work as a Segment Producer.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-5">The day rate is the default rate you ask for one day of work. It is not displayed in your profile but serves as a base when people try to book you through Qyre. Do you usually work longer contracts or with a monthly salary? Don&#x27;t worry, the day rate serves more as an indication than something fixed and you can negotiate terms and rates freely within the app. But keep in mind that depending on what type of employment you choose you should include taxes. I.e. if you&#x27;re self-employed and send invoices, the day rate should include the full amount you invoice, but not VAT. If you however want to get paid in salary, the day rate should not include general payroll tax (arbetsgivaravgifter).</p>

              <p class="paragraph-5">To create a production, you will start by visiting the production tab in the center of the bottom app menu. To create a new production simply tap the plus sign in the top right corner and your off! You will now be asked for a production name and description and you can choose if you want to upload a production image. In this production setup process, you will also be asked to provide start and end dates for your production. If you are unsure of anything, don&#x27;t worry, everything can be edited later. You can now complete the production setup by choosing one of two options at the bottom of the screen. You can either choose to &quot;create blank&quot; which will give you an empty timeline or &quot;use a template&quot; which will allow you to select from 3 different crew sizes. If you select &quot;create blank&quot; you will add every role individually rather than &quot;use a template&quot; which lays out a timeline and crew size for you. The template is just a starting point and you can always move people around as well as add or remove roles.</p>

Select the role you want to add, the number of people for that role you need and the start and end dates of that role. Save the role, and tap on the newly created role from the timeline view. Click on the freelancer slot and browse a freelancer to add to this role. Select the freelancer to add them to the role. Tap on the freelancer you just added and select adjust offer in the bottom left corner. You can now adjust your offer to the freelancer by adjusting the total or day rate. Feel free to add a message, toggle between invoice and salary or select production administrator in order to give the freelancer administrative privileges such as staffing a production, creating posts and more. To send the offer, click the green send offer button on the bottom. You can always adjust the offer after you have sent it.</p>

After you have created your production and from the production dashboard, you will access the timeline by clicking on the menu arrow in the upper right hand corner. Your timeline will automatically span the dates you specified when creating your production. If you want to change the dates simply tap the 3 dot edit button in the bottom left of the app.</p>

You will notice that you have three buttons at the bottom of the job offer - Reject, Adjust offer and Accept. If you click &quot;Reject&quot; the offer will be rejected and removed. If you click &quot;Accept&quot; you accept the offer and will be added to the production. If you click &quot;Adjust offer&quot; you can send a counter offer with adjusted pay. You can add a message to your counter offer or discuss freely by clicking the chat button in the top right corner.
